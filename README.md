# Sudoku-Solver
 
Sudoku is an extremely popular logic and combinatorial math-based puzzle that millions attempt on a daily basis online and on paper. This project implements a Sudoku game in Python with an in-built automatic puzzle solver ( ***Backtracking algorithm*** to find and evaluate candidate solutions recursively ) to add some ***Artificial Intelligence***. This game will allow the users to enter the numbers into the grid interactively as per the rules. This game is made following an online tutorial and added additional features to it.
